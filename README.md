# numberGame
This repository contains a simple Java console-based number guessing game. The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 10, and the user is prompted to guess the number. After each guess, the program provides feedback indicating whether the guess was too low or correct, and it tracks the number of attempts taken to guess the correct number.
